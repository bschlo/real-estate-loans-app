# Real Estate Loans App

## Project Description

My project will make tracking new deals for real estate loans easier. The interface will allow a user, such as a broker or a developer to post a new deal they need financing for and keep track of it. As a part of one of my stretch goals, the client, such as a bank or a private credit fund, will then be able to see the deals in their pipeline once the broker has granted them access to the deal. 

My idea for the Real Estate Loans App comes from my experience in real estate finance. Whilst working in the industry, we would have a pipeline with a plethora of potential deals which became hard to track from the various email threads and Drop Box links. My app will help users organize the deals in their pipeline and eventually will be a platform where brokers can post deals for clients to see.
